## Security

Code must conform to SCE's [Cybersecurity Administrative Standard](https://edisoninternational.navexone.com/content/docview/?docid=1592) and [Secure Coding Standard](https://edisonintl.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/itprocess/Guidelines/Secure%20Coding%20Standards.docx?d=w4816eab47cc0494d93990c3f11bd71b8&csf=1&web=1&e=QBNe6d).

Per these standards:
- All projects are required to perform code scanning
- All 3rd party code or libraries must be reviewed
- Secrets must not be stored in source code.

Unremediated vulnerabilities must be assessed by Cyber Risk.

Critical vulnerabilities may only suppressed with an accepted Cyber Risk exception.
